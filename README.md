# PairsStripes
MapReduce program that counts the pairs of movies that users gave a rating of 4 or higher from the MovieLens dataset.  The purpose of the program is to compare the communication cost associated with the pairs and stripes methods of writing the Mapreduce programs.  The stripes method reduces the number of keys that are shuffled across the network.
